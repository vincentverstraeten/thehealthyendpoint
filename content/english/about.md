In 2016 i got diagnosed with MS and had to quit my job as a schoolteacher. 

Switched fulltime to IT and specialised myself in device management. 

Now i'm on a path of constant learning and i love what i do now.

I live as healthy as possible on a wholefood plant-based "hence the name of this blog" and try to stay really active.

I hope you enjoy reading some of my contributions.
